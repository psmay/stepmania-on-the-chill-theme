It is based on the default theme by Midiman (of [SSC](http://ssc.ajworld.net)), and is actually intended to remain close enough to track most fixes/updates that apply to the original.\r\n\r\n## The original theme\r\n\r\nThis is a fork of [a repo I started to track only the `Themes/default` directory within the main StepMania project](https://github.com/psmay/stepmania-default-theme).\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nThe notable changes include these:\r\n\r\n* Palette of cooler and colder blues in place of the sunny yellows and oranges.\r\n* New logotype and artwork for title and menu screens.\r\n\t* Original typeface from logotype, a work in progress, may eventually be incorporated as fonts in-game.\r\n* Parallax cloud effects for some backgrounds.\r\n* Vector-based re-renders (and, in places, reinterpretations) of some images.\r\n\r\n\r\n## More details\r\n\r\n[See the GitHub repo](https://github.com/psmay/stepmania-on-the-chill-theme) for more specific information.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
